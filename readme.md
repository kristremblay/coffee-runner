## Coffee Runner
*Coffee is the lifeblood of the office.  Occasionally, when the office coffee maker just can't satisfy, a noble soul may
venture out into the wild to seek adequate caffeination.  This age-old practice is known colloquially as the Coffee Run,
and this application seeks to aid in keeping the tradition strong.*
